# Radio Bot Legacy

## Introduction


Welcome to the old Radio Bot source code. This code was the heart and soul of the bot after it took over from the old private release version after it couldn't handle the user base and meet the general functioning requirements that Radio Bot needed. This code ran from August 2019 until March 2020 where it was made difficult to maintain as myself (the only developer) was unable to maintain it efficiently. At this point as well Radio Bot became so popular that multiple shards were needed to run it (as required by discord.py) and this itself was challenging to constantly maintain 6/7 shards which is what we had going at the time. Also running all the shards was very costly and drained my wallet very quickly although we did have some Patreons it was soon getting too much to continue with general life getting in the way as well.

So here you have it, feel free to have a nosey about and see the utterly shambolic code which once upon a time served over 8000 servers. The code wasn't intended for public release hence why its so messy and it was written in a way that I understood it. I also changed my style of programming many times over the couple of years the various bits of code was written so sorry for the confusion.



## Support



At first I was reluctant to offer support with the code but im going to be nice. If you have any questions of need any help I will do my best to answer. Head over to [our Discord](https://discord.gg/fpDHRE6) server and drop your message in [#legacy-code-support](https://discord.gg/R55k896Xmt) and I will do my best to help out (I cant guarantee it though). You are also welcome to create an issue directly on the repo.



## Disclaimer



All code in this repo is old discord.py and will not work with the new version of discord.py. I personally don't even know what version discord.py even is at this moment in time let alone what has changed. You will need to adapt any of the code you wish to use to the new version of discord.py, you may find one or two pieces may not need changing.



## Copyright & Fair Use  



I've released this code on the grounds that you are able to learn and understand how audio streams can be brought into Discord bots. By all means feel free to use the code and alter it although don't attempt to create a clone of Radio Bot. I'm not saying don't add radio into your bot, I'm just saying make sure you remove anything named Radio Bot and don't start a cloned "Radio Bot".
