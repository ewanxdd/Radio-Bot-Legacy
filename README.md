# Radio Bot Legacy

## Introduction


Welcome to the old Radio Bot source code. This code was the heart and soul of the bot after it took over from the old private release version after it couldn't handle the user base and meet the general functioning requirements that Radio Bot needed. This code ran from August 2019 until March 2020 where it was made difficult to maintain as myself (the only developer) was unable to maintain it efficiently. At this point as well Radio Bot became so popular that multiple shards were needed to run it (as required by discord.py) and this itself was challenging to constantly maintain 6/7 shards which is what we had going at the time. Also running all the shards was very costly and drained my wallet very quickly although we did have some Patreons it was soon getting too much to continue with general life getting in the way as well.

So here you have it, feel free to have a nosey about and see the utterly shambolic code which once upon a time served over 8000 servers. The code wasn't intended for public release hence why its so messy and it was written in a way that I understood it. I also changed my style of programming many times over the couple of years the various bits of code was written so sorry for the confusion.
